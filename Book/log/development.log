This book is about functional programming, which is a different way to write software programs. “Different” means different from the “traditional” way of writing software, which is called the imperative paradigm. This book is about applying the functional paradigm to Java programming. There’s no such thing as a “functional language.” There are only languages that are more-or-less functional-friendly. Although I use Java in this book, you can apply all the principles I teach to any other language. Only the way in which you implement these principles would be different. You can write functional programs in any language, even those said not to be functional at all; you can similarly write imperative programs with the most functional-friendly languages."}, "commit"=>"Create Note"}

He put nothing off limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. And Jobs speaks candidly, sometimes brutally so, about the people he worked with and competed against.

Ella is wracked with guilt over what she failed to do, and she’s not the only one who can’t forget.

Its new features and concepts can be adopted to solve a variety of modern-day problems. This book enables you to adopt an objective approach to common problems by explaining the correct practices and decisions with respect to complexity, performance, readability, and more.\r\n\r\nJava Coding Problems will help you complete your daily tasks and meet deadlines. You can count on the 300+ applications containing 1,000+ examples in this book to cover the common and fundamental areas of interest: strings, numbers, arrays, collections, data structures, date and time, immutability, type inference, Optional, Java I/O, Java Reflection, functional programming, concurrency and the HTTP Client API. Put your skills on steroids with problems that have been carefully crafted to highlight and cover the core knowledge that is accessed in daily work. In other words (no matter if your task is easy, medium or complex) having this knowledge under your tool belt is a must, not an option.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this book, you will have gained a strong understanding of Java concepts and have the confidence to develop and choose the right solutions to your problems.", "author"=>"Anghel Leonard"}, "commit"=>"Create Note"}

Put your skills on steroids with problems that have been carefully crafted to highlight and cover the core knowledge that is accessed in daily work. In other words (no matter if your task is easy, medium or complex) having this knowledge under your tool belt is a must, not an option.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this book, you will have gained a strong understanding of Java concepts and have the confidence to develop and choose the right solutions to your problems."], ["author", "Anghel Leonard"], ["created_at", "2021-01-30 06:35:46.771235"], ["updated_at", "2021-01-30 06:35:46.771235"], ["user_id", 3], ["category_id", 2], ["note_img_file_name", "61F-wMUQ5ML.jpg"], ["note_img_content_type", "image/jpeg"], ["note_img_file_size", 110217], ["note_img_updated_at", "2021-01-30 06:35:45.034784"]]
